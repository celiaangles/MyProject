# KATANA GAME

Game inspired on the musical univers of Indira Paganotto, specially the album "Red Ninja" with oriental inspirations. My game consist on a race to collect katanas to finish the game. Meanwhile, the player should avoid obstacles as trees and temples generated randomly. The difficulty of the game increases graduately.

## GAME RULES

The game rules are pretty simple. The player should collect 5 katanas to pass to the winner page. If the player collides with an obstacle the game stops and you lose the score. There is the possibility to restart the game from the beggining. There are two different types of jumps depending on the time you maintain the space pressed.

## TECHN0LOGIES USED

The project is created with a combination of Java Script, CSS and Java Script. Eventhought there are different types of styles to create a game we followed the DOM structure which is based on the creation of classes, constructor, methods... I specially understood how to use the random generation of objects.
